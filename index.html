		<b>Wellerman Lyrics:</b>
		<br>
		<br>There once was a ship that put to sea
		<br>The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
		<br>The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
		<br>Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>She'd not been two weeks from shore
		<br>When down on her a right whale bore
		<br>The captain called all hands and swore
		<br>He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
		<br>
		<br>Before the boat had hit the water
		<br>The whale's tail came up and caught her
		<br>All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
		<br>When she dived down low (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>No line was cut, no whale was freed
		<br>The captain's mind was not of greed
		<br>And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
		<br>She took that ship in tow (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
		<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
		<br>
		<br>For forty days or even more
		<br>The line went slack then tight once more
		<br>All boats were lost, there were only four
		<br>But still that whale did go (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
		<br>The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
		<br>The Wellerman makes his regular call
		<br>To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
		<br>
		<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
		<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
		<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
		<br>We'll take our leave and go
